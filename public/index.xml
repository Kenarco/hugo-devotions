		<description>&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:1)  He also said to the disciples, “There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:2)  And he called him and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprising as it may be, Jesus said more about money than about any other single subject. Fully one-sixth of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke deal with money—as do twelve of the thirty-eight parables. Why? A study several years ago revealed that the average American adult male spends 50 percent of his time dealing with money-related matters—how to make more, how to spend less, what to do with what he has. No wonder, then, that Jesus had so much to say about money. The longest chapter in the Bible, Psalm 119, deals with the Word. But the second longest, Numbers 7, is all about
the giving of money. I find this to be significant. Here in our text, Jesus weighs in on the matter…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:3)  And the manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:4)  I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.’

&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:5)  So, summoning his master&amp;rsquo;s debtors one by one, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:6)  He said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:7)  Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing his days of employment were numbered, the steward devised a plan whereby he cut in half the debts of those who owed his employer money, knowing they would return the favor by taking care of him when he was out of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:8)  The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the master discovered what his steward had done, far from chastising him for his dishonesty, he commended him for his ingenuity.

How true. The people in the world are on the phone talking to their investment counselors, checking figures on their calculators, shrewdly and carefully planning for their future. Not so the children of light. We are not as aggressive or as wise in preparing for our eternal future as our worldly colleagues are in preparing for their temporal future. This ought not be. After using the incident of the shrewd unjust servant as an example of one who is preparing and planning for the future, Jesus plunges into a discourse about the believer and money in which He will identify four benefits of giving…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:9)  And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked how much money his father left when he died, Andrew Carnegie&amp;rsquo;s son gave a classic answer when he shrugged his shoulders and simply said, &amp;ldquo;Everything.&amp;rdquo; How true. The old adage is correct: You can&amp;rsquo;t take it with you. But equally true is the fact that you can send it ahead. The money you give to the Lord is sent ahead, waiting for you in heaven.
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
I may not know exactly what Jesus meant when he said the money we send ahead to heaven will be waiting with a habitation for me to dwell in. But this I do know: When we get to heaven, not one person will say, &amp;ldquo;Is this all there is? I wish I had spent the money I gave to the Lord on a new VCR or blender.&amp;rdquo; No! We&amp;rsquo;re going to say, &amp;ldquo;Wow! What a deal! I traded in that junk for this glory!&amp;rdquo;

In the early 1800s, Prussia&amp;rsquo;s King Friedrich Wilhelm III was involved in battles against other European countries that bled his bank account. In desperate need of funds to keep his war machine going, he asked the women of his empire to donate their gold jewelry to the war effort. In exchange, they were given chunks of iron fashioned into crosses and were made members of the Order of the Iron Cross—an Order that would go on to impact history. Unlike King Friedrich Wilhelm III, our King isn&amp;rsquo;t bankrupt. On the contrary, He says, &amp;ldquo;Give Me your chunks of iron, and I&amp;rsquo;ll give you gold and silver in return. Trade in the stuff you&amp;rsquo;re wasting, and see what I will bless you with in the kingdom to come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:10)  “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
(Luk 16:11)  If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving releases us in ministry. I might not be able to sing; you might not be able to preach. But one thing is common to everyone in this room: money. Therefore, the Lord uses money as the ultimate test to see if He can entrust to us even greater ministry. This is why D. L. Moody said, &amp;ldquo;I can see more about the spirituality of a man by reading through his checkbook than I can by reading through his prayer book.&amp;rdquo; Anyone can write flowery phrases, but giving is the true barometer of where one is at spiritually.

&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t make hardly any money,&amp;rdquo; you say. Oh, but if you make even fifteen thousand dollars a year between the ages of twenty and sixty, you will have been entrusted with more than half a million dollars in your lifetime.
&amp;ldquo;What are you going to do with it?&amp;rdquo; asks Jesus. &amp;ldquo;If I can trust you with the least, with unrighteous mammon, I can open up doors of other ministry for you proportionately. But if you are unfaithful with money, I cannot commit to you the true riches of a fuller, more impacting ministry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:12)  And if you have not been faithful in that which is another&amp;rsquo;s, who will give you that which is your own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving replenishes us financially. We have been entrusted with that which is Another&amp;rsquo;s. That is, specifically, though not exclusively, the Lord has given to us the first-fruits that are His (Lev_23:10). What are first-fruits? First-fruits are the tithe. The word &amp;ldquo;tithe&amp;rdquo; simply means &amp;ldquo;tenth.&amp;rdquo; Therefore, the first tenth of everything we make is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s. When the offering plate is passed in front of us, I&amp;rsquo;m sure none of us is tempted to reach in and take a handful of money to keep for ourselves. Yet when I don&amp;rsquo;t tithe I am doing just that. I am robbing God of what is His (Mal_3:8).
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
To those who protest that the concept of tithing being prescribed in the law is no longer relevant to those who live under grace, I point out the following: Tithing is seen prior to the law when Abraham tithed to Melchizedek (Gen_14:20). Tithing was commended by Jesus when He told the Pharisees that, although they should remember justice and mercy, they should not cease to tithe (Luk_11:42). Tithing was taught by the apostle Paul when he told the Corinthians to give according to how God had prospered them (1Co_16:2)—which the early church took to mean tithing, as seen in the writings of Jerome and Chrysostom. Tithing precedes the law, is spoken of by the Lord, and is seen in the Epistles. Therefore, to say tithing is not applicable in this dispensation is, I believe, a failure to understand the full counsel of Scripture and church history. And what is the result of this failure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.—Mal_3:9
We&amp;rsquo;re cursed with a curse. What curse?
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.—Hag_1:9
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
You bring home your paycheck, but where does it go? The Lord says, &amp;ldquo;I blew on it and it scattered. It&amp;rsquo;s cursed because you&amp;rsquo;ve robbed Me. What could have been, what should have been, what would have been can&amp;rsquo;t be because the blessing is removed.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.—Mal_3:10
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
This is the only place in all of Scripture where God says, &amp;ldquo;Prove Me.&amp;rdquo; And if we do, we&amp;rsquo;ll see three things happen…
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Reward. The Lord will open the windows of heaven and bless us in ways we can&amp;rsquo;t possibly imagine.
And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.—Mal_3:11
Rebuke. Satan is a destroyer, a murderer, a devourer. If you can recall times when you&amp;rsquo;ve robbed God and things started happening—refrigerators burned out, cars broke down—and you wondered what was going on, it could be that you removed yourself from the promise of covering; that you made yourself vulnerable to the devouring of the Enemy.
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.—Mal_3:12
Revival. When we tithe, fruitfulness will reign in our lives once again to such a degree that even those around us will notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luk 16:13)  No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The love of money is the root of all evil,&amp;rdquo; Paul declared (see 1Ti_6:10). How can mere paper or copper or silver be the root of all evil? Just as the simple clay idols of Baal, Ashteroth, Moloch, and other Old Testament entities had spirits behind them, mammon is a powerful spiritual force behind the money in our pockets that seeks to dominate, defile, and destroy us. Thus, either the spirit of mammon and Madison Avenue will control us, or the Spirit of God will. But we can&amp;rsquo;t serve both.

Abraham, the friend of God, had just rescued his nephew, Lot, from captivity. On his way home, he was met by Melchizedek, the king of Salem, who was, I believe, a preincarnate appearance of Jesus. After being presented with bread and wine, Abraham fell down and worshiped Melchizedek, giving tithes to him of all he had taken.
In the next verse, guess who came slithering up to Abraham? The king of Sodom. &amp;ldquo;Thanks, Abraham, for what you&amp;rsquo;ve done,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;You can keep all the goods that you took.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
But Abraham looked at the king of Sodom, the prince of perversity, and said, &amp;ldquo;I will not take one shoelace from you,&amp;rdquo; refusing to take from Sodom the goods of the world (Genesis 14).
What gave Abraham power over the pull of the world? Giving tithes to the Prince of Peace. That&amp;rsquo;s what tithing does. The world tempts me; advertisers scream at me, people tell me, &amp;ldquo;You need this. You must have that. Why not buy the other?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m vulnerable—and so are you. The king of Sodom has our number. He knows exactly what bauble, what trinket to wave in front of us to get us caught up in the foolish and vain pursuit of the latest fad. How can we overcome him? Tithe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I tithe, even as Abraham did, I give away part of my greediness, my covetousness, my selfishness. Tithing changes my personality because I&amp;rsquo;m not a giver by nature. I&amp;rsquo;m a hoarder, a collector, a keeper. Not so my Father. God is a Giver (Joh_3:16; Jas_1:17). And He wants me to be like Him. In putting money in the basket, you give away part of your carnality. That is why our Father lovingly says, &amp;ldquo;Give to Me—not because I need the money, but because you need to be set free.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
